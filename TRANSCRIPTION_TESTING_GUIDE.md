## Troubleshooting

### Attendee Sees No Transcriptions
1. **Check backend console**: Look for `📝 Transcription update received`
2. **Check frontend console**: Look for `Transcription update:` logs
3. **Verify room code**: Ensure attendee joined correct room
4. **Check socket connection**: Look for `Socket connected` in console
5. **Restart backend**: Sometimes socket connections need refresh

### Summary Button Disabled
1. **Check transcriptionsByPage**: Must have at least 1 slide with transcriptions
2. **Check console**: Look for `transcriptionsByPage keys:` log
3. **Verify recording happened**: Must have actual spoken content
4. **Check Gemini API key**: Must be set in `.env.local`

### PDF Not Downloading
1. **Check browser console**: Look for errors
2. **Verify Gemini API**: Check `NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY`
3. **Check popup blocker**: May block automatic downloads
4. **Try different browser**: Test in Chrome vs Firefox

### Transcriptions Not Syncing
1. **Check socket connection**: Both sides must be connected
2. **Verify room code**: Must be exact match
3. **Check backend logs**: Look for broadcast confirmation
4. **Restart backend server**: Clear any stuck state
